<b>cfgparser-c: Configuration file parser in C.</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This small program demonstrates how to parse and retrieve structured key-value pairs, using only plain C strings library. The main() implementation can be easily transformed into a lightweight string-based parser of key-value pairs with or without section labels. Section labels should be enclosed on brackets '[' and ']', multi-value keys should begin with asterisk '*' to flag multiple token parsing, comments are marked with ';' and text is skipped therafter. See '/examples' folder and corresponding output for capabilities.</p>
