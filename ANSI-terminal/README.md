<b>ANSI-terminal: Terminal escape codes for basic text/screen handling.</b>

Description:<br/>
In early VT100 terminals, as well as older DOS x86 machines, ANSI escape codes were the only way to handle screen, e.g. move the cursor position and make the text bold or blink. This is a small interface for using such functionality, provided that ANSI device manager is installed (in DOS this is 'ANSI.SYS'). See 'ANSI.pdf' in 'doc' folder for more details about screen modes and escape codes.
