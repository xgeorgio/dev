<BR><H1><B><CENTER>General Description</CENTER></B></H1><BR>
The Pegasys service in its present form is the result of academic projects
and research work on the fields of protein prediction, artificial neural networks,
on-line distributed Web systems and Java technology.
<P>
The early versions of the system were developed at the <A HREF="http://www.uoi.gr">University of 
Ioannina</A> , in the <A HREF="http://www.cs.uoi.gr">Department of Computer 
Science</A>. The most recent versions, including this one, were released as a
publicly available software package, available as a distributed client/server
application, using Java applet technologies and dynamic loading-execution
to make it accessible through any Java-enabled Web browser.
<P>
Its purpose is to help molecular biologists and genetic engineers to identify 
the most "suitable" class (one of the 48) of a protein sequence, by calculating 
the base correlation frequencies and analyzing them through a specially trained 
neural network.<P>
The hole system is implemented purely in Java programming language (Java API 1.1.4).
It contains the client program (Pegasus client), in the form of
a Java applet, and the prediction system (Pegasus server), including the network server,
the ANN prediction system and the internal mailing support services. Every user
can access the WWW client page and activate the (latest version of the) client
program. No need of pre-installed components, no need for installation updates.

<BR><H2>Pegasus Client Program</H2>
The Pegasus client program is implemented as a Java applet. It contains a very 
friendly and easy-to-use user interface that is suitable for any user level. It 
provides all the necessary means to create an analysis request, send the request 
to the analysis server, monitor the network traffic and the analysis process, 
and finally get the results. All these capabilities are implemented in three 
forms, each one representing a process stage: input, process, output. 
<P>

<H3><B><I>Input stage</I></B></H3>
<P>
The input form contains a set of fields, used to identify a user, an analysis 
type selector and a textbox used to type-in the sequence data. Although the user 
authentication fields are quite a few, only the "E-mail" field is required for a 
valid analysis request. These fields are used only to provide some statistics 
about the traffic and the users accessing the server. The "User-ID" field is 
intended to be used in future versions, to provide some priority privileges on 
server to "registered" users, against any-user. This does NOT mean that only 
registered users can use the server, this was never the intention. Anyway, the 
program is at the evaluation stage for the time, so all users are "equal" to the 
server.
<P>
The field "Process type" field can be used to determine the processing mode.
The user can interactively access the system, sending the request and waiting for the
results. Alternatively, the batch mode processing is used to "post" the request to the
server and disconnecting, receiving the results at a later time via e-mail. This type
of processing is convinient for long-time processing sessions, or just to get a compact
form of the result data. The third option combines the two previous options, that is using
interactive sessions and receiving the result data via e-mail at the same time.
<P>
The "Sequence data" field is the textbox in which the 
user types-in the sequence. No special format is used, valid is any string 
containing protein bases (character symbols, lowercase or uppercase) in 
sequence, formated in any way using multiple lines of text, blank spaces, tab characters
or index numbers.
<P>
The analysis can be made in the whole sequence or in seperate "windows" of subsequencies,
according to the nature of the problem and the prediction precision specifications. 
In this case, the "Window size" field defines the subsequences (window) length and the
"Threshold" fields define the upper and lower limits of certainty for the final results.
<P>

<H3><B><I>Process stage</I></B></H3>
<P>
After all necessary fields have been completed, the "Send" button creates a 
request packet that is sent to the server. The client connects to server, the 
form switches to "process" mode and shows two status lines that inform the user 
about the current process stage and status. The user may press the "Cancel" 
button at any time to abort the process. If an error has happened, the user may 
press the "Retry" button to restart the connection.
<P>

<H3><B><I>Output stage</I></B></H3>
<P>
When analysis has completed, the server sends the results to the client. The 
client switches to "output" mode and a form similar to the first one appears, 
only now it is read-only. The new form is filled with fields explaining
the various analysis parameters and results, according to the type and mode of
the processing (total or windowed).
<P>
After the user has processed the results, the "Close"
button switches the client (and form) to "input" mode, ready for a new analysis request.
<P>

<BR><H2>Pegasus Server Program</H2>
The protein prediction program is a specially designed and trained neural 
network, implemented pure Java. The server relays the sequence data the ANN prediction system,
executing a separate prediction for each analysis window (and the whole sequence itself) in
three different ANN network configurations. The final result for each sequence is calculated
using a majority rule on the individual results and the total prediction for windowed analysis
is calculated using a "maximum-category-frequence" factor in the windowed analysis result set.
<P>
Due to the security restrictions on Java applets, the server program is implemented as iterative,
executing a single prediction at any time. Although the analysis process is quite complex, the
efficient pure Java implementation and the iterative (single-user) type of processing makes the
service capable of completing each request in just a few seconds. That is why, from an external
point of view, the service reacts nearly like a simple UDP service, rather than a heavyweight
session-oriented client queueing server (which, in fact, is the truth!).

Here are some details about the people who perceived and implemented the
whole idea of an on-line protein prediction system for the World Wide Web,
