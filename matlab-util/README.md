<b>Matlab/Octave tools for signal processing and statistics.</b>

Description:<br/>
This is a useful general-purpose toolbox for Matlab/Octave with utilities and tools, as well as algorithms for signal processing and statistics:
<ul>
  <li><strong>'/gen'</strong>: Matlab/Octave detection, ETA in processing (iterations), Haversine 2D/3D geo-distance, file handling, alert sound, dataset shuffling, grid size from aspect ratio (for subplot), Stirling numbers of 2nd kind (number of set partitions).</li>
  <li><strong>'/sig'</strong>: Data series rescaling, normalization, smoothing, basic statistics, detrending, entropy, zero-crossings, roughness index, noise functions (whitening, PSNR), error functions (RMSE), cross-entropy, mutual information, multiple correlation coefficient, Wiener filter design.</li>
  <li><strong>'/stat'</strong>: Matrix sparsity, Minimum Description Length (MDL), cross-correlation, Bhattacharyya distance, Chernoff bound, linear regression error.</li>
  <li><strong>'/stat/ChEqu'</strong>: Reference package for adaptive channel equalization, it includes base implementations for the LMS and RLS algorithms.</li>
  <li><strong>'/stat/Levi1'</strong>: Reference for noise cancelling via FIR Wiener filtering, it includes base implementation for the Levinson-Durbin algorithm (linear system solver).</li>
</ul>
