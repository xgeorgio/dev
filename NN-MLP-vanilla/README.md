<p>Algorithms for Medical Image Analysis â€“ Part I: Applications Programming (in Greek)</p>
<p>H. Georgiou. Book published by Arnaoutis Publ. (Oct. 2012). The book is the first part of a two-volume work on all the intermediate processing levels in Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) or Automated Computer Diagnosis (ACD), focused primarily on the programming and development of relevant applications. It also covers all the necessary background theory and algorithms for Image Analysis and Medical Imaging, as well as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. All the material covered in this book is complete and independent, focusing on the characterization of ultrasonic images of human liver for diagnostic purposes, employing a wide variety of methodologies of statistical image analysis and Machine Learning. The same material has been used for lectures and tutorials in graduate (BSc) and post-graduate (MSc) level courses taught by the author for many years, in relation to Artificial Intelligence and Digital Imaging, as well as programming algorithms for Pattern Recognition. The book is accompanied by full source code (ANSI C/C++) of more than 12.000 lines and complete description of the implemented full applications that are presented therein.</p>
