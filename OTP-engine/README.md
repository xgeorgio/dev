<b>OTP-engine: Minimalistic OTP generator in Java.</b>

Description:<br/>
This small program is a One-Time Pad generator for cryptographic purposes. It uses crypto-strong randomizers from Java's secure framework, thus the generated OTPs can be considered (also tested with proper tools) as almost-purely random noise. The generated file can also be distributed as selective (offset-based) secure seeds to weaker PRNGs.
